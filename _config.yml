  desc: My name is Clément Gaultier, I work as a PhD student in the PANAMA team mainly on solving acoustic and audio signal processing inverse problems. From November 2015 I have been working on declipping and denoising using analysis/synthesis sparse priors. I also work on binaural sound source localization with massive regressions machine learning techniques. Additionally, I am really interested in the auditory system and topics such as augmented hearing, speech enhancement or hearing protection.
