    "des": "Welcome to my webpage. My strong insterest in sound, acoustics or hearing drove me towards graduate studies specialized notably in acoustics and a PhD specialized in audio signal processing. My research topics mainly comprise solving acoustic and audio signal processing inverse problems. During my PhD I had been working on declipping and denoising using analysis/synthesis sparse priors. I also worked on binaural sound source localization with massive regressions machine learning techniques. Additionally, I am really interested in the auditory system and topics such as augmented hearing, speech enhancement or hearing protection."
